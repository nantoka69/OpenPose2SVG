# OpenPose2SVG

**OpenPose2SVG** is a Python-based desktop application designed to visualize OpenPose JSON data and export it as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Built with PyQt6, it offers a user-friendly interface for loading pose data, previewing the skeleton, and saving high-quality vector illustrations so that the pose can be edited externally with tools like Inkscape.

## Features

- **Load OpenPose JSON**: Import JSON files generated by OpenPose containing keypoint data.
- **Visual Preview**: Real-time rendering of pose skeletons, including body parts and connections.
- **SVG Export**: Save the visualized pose as a clean, editable SVG file.
